# Machine Learning-Based Network Intrusion Detection System

This project presents a Machine Learning-based Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS)
designed to detect malicious network traffic using supervised learning techniques.
The study focuses on improving intrusion detection accuracy using the Random Forest algorithm.

## Project Overview
Network Intrusion Detection Systems are essential for identifying cyber-attacks in
computer networks. Traditional signature-based systems struggle with new and evolving
attacks. This project applies machine learning techniques to automatically classify
network traffic as normal or malicious.

## Dataset
The NSL-KDD dataset was used in this study. It is a publicly available benchmark dataset
for evaluating intrusion detection systems.
